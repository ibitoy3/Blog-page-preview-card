## My process

The process involved a use of BEM and semantics, styling the document-block from start to end

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I improved further, my knowledge on the use of Flex, which now helps me to create a mental map in my head for the design process.

### Continued development

I will be focusing on Flexbox, trying to figure out it's limitations by extensive use.
